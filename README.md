# README

Just like with the Ruby course, I'm going to document my trials and travails of getting through the Rails course.
So far, it's half voodoo and half wtf do you mean there's no gem installed or ruby version differences.

* Lesson 1 - Introduction
* Lesson 2 - Create App
  * This seems fairly straight forward
* Lesson 3 - Views and Controllers
  * Fought a little with webpacker on this one and just generalized differences between my environment and the cleaner environment the instructor has
* Lesson 4 - Models
  * Yep.  Rails = Voodoo.  But, the migrations works fairly similarly to Entity Framework so it wasn't completely unfamiliar
